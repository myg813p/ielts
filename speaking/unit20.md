Unit 20.

Part I.

1. Tell me about a noise that you can hear around your home.
Most of the noises I hear around my apartment are those of animals and birds. One of my neighbors has a puppy and sometimes it makes a howling noise at night. Moreover, pigeons like to sit on my apartment's balcony rails, so I often hear them in the morning.

2. What kinds of sounds do you like?
My favorite sound is that of the ocean waves gently breaking onto the shore. It is one of the reasons that I sometimes go to the beach. The sound is not only soothing and relaxing, but it also reminds me of the time I used to live near the sea.

3. What kinds of sounds do you dislike?
I don't like most loud noises. For instance, I hate the sounds of sirens, alarms, car horns, and engine noises. Morever, I sometimes get annoyed by loud music, such as heavy metal, too.

4. In which kind of place do you prefer to work or study, a noisy place or a quiet place?
I like places that are slightly noisy. When I work or study in quiet places like libraries, I have to be careful not to make loud noises myself. As a result, I'm too uncomfortable to concentrate on my task. On the other hand, if there's too much noise, I get distracted by it, so I become unproductive.

5. Do you think there is a lot of noise in your city or town?
I think my town is relatively quite. There aren't any loud places such as airports or big construction sites in my area. Even though I can sometimes hear the blaring of car horns, it happens very rarely and doesn't bother me much.

6. Are traffic jams a big issue in your city?
They certainly are one of the biggest problems our city faces. I live in a big city with a lot of cars, so traffic becomes really slow at times. Because of that, I am sometimes laste for appointments or classes even when I leave home early.

7. What can you do to help reduce traffic jams?
One of the contributions I can make to reducing traffic jams is using the subway more often. From what I see, traffic jams happen when there are too many private vehicles on the road. Therefore, by taking the subway instead of driving, I'll be reducing the number of cars on the road.

8. Do you obey the law all the time?
Yes, I almost always abide by the law and I think it is important to do so. However, I sometimes jaywalk when there are no oncoming cars. Even though I'm aware that it's not the right thing to do, I sometimes can't resist when I'm late for something.



PART 2&3

1. Describe an important law.
There are so many important laws, but some of the most important laws are copyright laws. Copyright laws are regulations that protect the creators of intellectual content, such as music, movies, and books. They prevent the distrubution of someone's work without their permission.
I first learned about copyright laws from an advertising campaign that urged people to respect copyrights. As a middle school student, I never really knew about copyrights and just downloaded songs and movies illegally. However, the government ran an ad campaign, and I learned that what I had been doing was wrong. I never downloaded anything without paying after that again.
I think copyright laws are important for several reasons. First, they ensure that creators get paid for their work. Without copyright protection, everything would be copied, and creators woundn't make money. Therefore, they would not be able to afford to make anything else. With copyright protection, they know that their work is protected from being copied, so they don't have to worry. This allows them to dedicate themselves to creating more.

2. Do you think people would perfer to be police officers or lawyers?
I think individual preferences differ from person to person but today, I think more poeple in Korea would perfer to be police officers. This is because police work provides more stability than being an attorney. In Korea, police officers are seen as some of the most secure public servant positions. They earn a steady income until they retire and they revieve a government pension as well after retirement. Due to the difficult job market these days, a lot of people want to find secure jobs, and being an officer seems quite attractive.

3. Does society need police officers?
I'd have to say that police officers are necessary for society. First of all, police officers are important for maintaining public safety. For instance, they lock up murderers and robbers. This prevents criminals from committing more crimes, which keeps people safe. Furthermore, they help maintain traffic safety and flow. They ensure that people do not drive too fast or get behind the wheel when they are intoxicated.

4. Describe a place with severe pollution that you have visited.
I've been to several polluted places, but the first one that comes to mind is Gyheongpo Beach which is located in Korea's Gangwon Province.
I visited this place with my family for summer vacation last year. I'd checked it out online and saw many beautiful pictures. In the pictures, I could see powdery sand and clear water. There was also a pine grove nearby, so people can enjoy both the ocean and the forest. So, I decided to visit with my family to enjoy this beautiful environment.
Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. The beach was pretty polluted, unlike the pictures we had seen. There was trash everywhere. Firework debris, empty bottles, and garbage covered the beach. There was even trash floating in the water. It was really gross.
Seeing this, I didn't know how to feel. I was disappointed, but I was sad as well. This is one of Korea's most beautiful landscapes, but people carelessly trashed it. I also felt a bit angry at how thoughtless we all are. If we were all a little more responsible and did our part to protect the environment, this would not have happened.

5. What is the biggest environmental issue these days?
There are so many environmental concerns out there, but I think the biggest one today is global warming. This is causing widespread habitat loss for animals in colder ecosystems, like the polar bear. Global warming is also negatively impacting humans. As temperatures rise, polar ice caps melt and cause sea level to rise. This could be a huge threat to people who live in coastal areas, where rising sea levels will lead to flooding.

6. What can we do to improve the environment?
To begin with, we can switch to renewable energy. Fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, are major contributors to environmental pollution. Switching to clean, renewable energy sources like solar and wind would reduce environmental damage. In addition, we can refrain from wasting energy. For example, instead of driving, people can use public transportation, walk, or ride bikes to get where they need to go.
