PART 2&3

1. Describe a park that you visit often.
There are several parks in my city, but my favorite is Han River Park. It is a city park located along the Han River in Seoul. From my house, it only takes about ten minutes to get there on foot.
Since it's so close, I go there at least once a week. I normally don't go until the weekend, when my friends or family can join me. However, I sometimes go alone during the week when I wnat to get some fresh air.
At the Han River Park, you can do a variety of things. It has some of the best bike paths, badminton courts, and flower gardens in the city. So, this park is a great choice if you want to play sports or look at colorful flowers. The best part is that all of these activities are open to the public and free of charge.
I visit this park quite often because it's the perfect place to relax. In a highly populated city like Seoul, the Han River Park is on of the few places to enjoy peace and quiet. I often go there just to sit on the grass and think without being interrupted by the sounds of the city.

2. What do people usually do at the park?
That depends on the person, but I think people usually use parks as places to relax and spend time with their friends. It's pretty common to see groups of people sitting on the grass and chatting. People visit parks to place sports as well. Whenever I go to the park, I always see people riding bicycles and using the basketball courts.

3. Do you think parks are important?
Yes, I think that parks are essential for several reasons. First, they provide people with a place to relax. People can unwind and rechargge while relaxing in the park. Also, parks are good places to exercise. Most parks have running trails, athletic courts, and exercise equipment. Thankfully, most of those are free for anyone to use.

4. Describe a sport that you've learned to play.
There are several sports that I've learned, but I;d like to tak about swimming, which is my favorite sprot these days. Swimming is a total body workout, which means that every muscle of the body is used. So. basically, it's one of the best workouts for building up one's physical strength.
I started swimming because I always had a fear of water and wanted to overcome that. I also thought it was an essentail life skill. Not knowing how to swim could have been deadly if I'd had an accident and somehow ended up in the water. I could have easily drowned. So I hhave it a go.
To learn how to swim, I signed up for swimming classes. When I first started swimming, I couldn't even float on my own! Thankfully, my swimming coach was very patient with me. Thanks to his help and encouragement, I continued taking lessons every morning for over a year.
I've experienced many benefits from swimming. Its greatest advantage is that I'm no longer scared of water. This has given me so much confidence and has made me feel like I can overcome anything. Second, it helps me to keep in shape. I don't have love handles anymore, like I used to!

5. Why do you think extreme sports are popular?
People are attracted to extreme sports for so many reasons. However, I think their biggerst draw is that theyh provide a thrill. Most people do the same boring things day after day. However, extreme sports are exciting and can break up the old routime. In addition, they give people a chance to test themselves. By pushing themselves to their physical limits, they learn that they are capable of much more than they thought.

6. Do you think students should take P.E classes?
Yes, they should because there are many benefits. For one, P.E. classes can teach valuable coooperation skills. For instance, when students play soccer in P.E. classes, they learn how to work as a team to score goals. On top of that, P.E. can improve s tudents' health and fitness considerably. Students today do not exercise enough and spend much of their time doing sedentary activities, like playing computer games. Therefore, having to exercise during the school day is highly beneficial for  their body.
