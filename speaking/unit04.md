PART I

1. What kind of songs do you like to sing?
I like merry and cheerful songs the best. That's because it's so fun to sing them with my friends at Karaoke. More specifically, I love the ones with silly lyrics or catchy melodies.

2. Did you learn to sing when you were a child?
Not really. Although I sang songs during music classes in elementary school, the teachers never really taught us how to sing. However, I wish my teacher did, because I love to sing.

3. Do people in your country like to sing? Why?
I think Koreans really do. For instance, there are a lot of Karaoke businesses in the country, and people of all ages love to go there. Besides, these days, many people take vocal training courses even when they don't plan to become professional singers.

4. Do you like dancing?
Yes, I like to dance. Even though I do not know many dances, I have several moves that never fail to impress my friends. So, whenever I have the chance, I perform my robot dance routine.

5. When do people usually dance in your country?
Koreans mostly dance when they are partying. Young people like to go to clubs to party and they usually dance to hip-hop or electronic music while there. In addition, Koreans also dance whenever there is a talent show.

6. Do you collect anything?
I collect coins from different counties. I started doing this because I love to travel overseas. So far, I have collected coins from several European and Asian countries, including France, Spain, Italy, Thailand, China, and Japan.

7. Why do you collect them?
I collect them because they remind me of good memories. For example, when I see the coins that I collected from various countries, I recall my experiences traveling to each of them. Also, all of them have unique designs, so I enjoy looking at them.

8. What do you do when you get streesed out?
Whenever I get stressed out, I like to discuss my problems with my friends. I talk about my feelings and they listen to me carefully. Sometimes, they give me advice on how to deal with my situation, too.

PART 2 & 3

1. Describe an activity that you do when you have free time.
When I have free time, I often go jogging with my jogging club. We jog for a couple of hours and then have dinner together afterwards. While we jog, we constantly cheer each other on.
When I jog, I use several different jogging courses. However, my favorites are the ones along the Han River and the Cheongye Stream. I can feel the breeze when I run along these bodies of water and it feels great.
It has been 2 years since I started jogging, and I've enjoyed every single minute of it.
There are a couple of reasons why I do this when I have free time. First, although the activity itself is exhausing, my body feels much lighter after I jog. Also, It seems to have made me healthier. I haven't caught a cold or had a headache since I started jogging. Moreover, I've made many friends in my jogging club. We get together often to buy sportswear and to just hang out.

2. What are the benefits of having free time?
There are tons of advantages to enjoying free time. For one, free time significantly reduces stress. Free time allows people to spend time doing the things they enjoy, which helps relieve stress and anxiety. In addition, it gives you the opportunity to recharge. This clears your head and allows you to focus better, which makes you more productive in the long run.

3. Are there any differences between how we spend our free time now and how we spent it previously?
Yes, we spend our free time differently now than we did in the past. The biggest difference is that modern people stay home more now than in the past due to technological development. For example, nowadays, people seem to stay home watching YouTube videos, listening to music, or surfing the internet on their smartphones. But, in the past, they went out to play sports or to stroll.

4. Describe the movie that you like the most.
There are many movies that I like, but my all-time favorite is Home Alone, which is a holiday comedy and action movie.
It's about a young boy named Kevin. On Christmas, his family accidentally forgets him when they leave for their Christmas vacation. Then, he is put in a situation where he has to defend the house against two thieves.
I have watched this movie at least 10 times because I have watched it every Christmas since I was young.
There are several reasons that I love this movie the most. First, it's good for a laugh. I like movies that make me laugh without thinking too seriously. In this movie there are no hidden serious messages - it's just fun to watch with a relaxed mind. Also, the actors' performances are great. The actor who plays Kevin is really good at acting, despite his young age. In addition, the performances by the supporting actors, the thieves, are so realistic that they really seem like bad guys.

5. What movie genre do people in your country enjoy most?
Individual preferences differ from person to person, but I think the most popular genre overall is comedy. This is because people these days experience a great deal of stress and worry. Watching funny movies allows them to forget about their concerns temporarily. When they laugh at something amusing or ridiculous on screen, their problems get pushed to the back of their minds.

6. Do people prefer watching movies at home or at a cinema?
I think many people would rather stay home to watch movies. First, watching them at home saves time and money. Movie theater tickets are quite pricey today. It also takes a while to get to the theater, if you don't live nearby. Second, watching movies at home is much more comfortable. At home, you can lie down on the sofa, chat with your family, and even pause the moive to run to the bathroom. However, at a cinema, none of these are possible.
