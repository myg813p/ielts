Unit11 Weather & Nature

PART1.

1. What is your favourite season?
Of the four seasons in my country, I like autumn the best. The weather is neither too hot nor too cold at that time. Likewise, the amount of sunlight is just right, so there are many beautiful sunny days in fall.

2. Do you like rainy days? Why?
Not at all. I hate it when my shoes and clothes get wet. Also, if there are strong winds, I get soaked whether I carry an umbrella or not. As a result, walking outside is absolutely horrible on such days.

3. Do you like sunny days? Why?
Certainly. Sunny days are my favorite kinds of days. I like the feeling of warm sunlight on my skin, and the sky is beautiful to behold when it is clear and blue. In addition, I tend to feel more energetic on days like these, so I'm more productive.

4. Is there a good place to go in your neighbourhood on sunny days?
Yes, there is a small park in my neighborhood that I like to go to when it's sunny. It has a couple of benches, so I can sit down and read books on one of them while enjoying the weather. Furthemore, there are several big trees with many branches, so I can take a seat in the shade if the sunlight becomes too intense.

5. Does the weather ever affect what you do?
No, not very much. On weekdays, I spend most of my time inside, so the weather doesn't affect me. However, when it rains, I like to drink twice as much coffee as I usually do to keep myself awake.

6. Have you ever taken care of flowers or any other type of plant?
Sure, I have. Someone gave my parents a potted plant several years ago, and I was charged with watering it. In the beginning, I made frequent mistakes because I was not sure how much water I should give it or how often. However, I became better at it over time, and the plant thrived.

7. Have you given flowers as a gift?
Of course. The last person I gave flowers to was my mother. I bought her a bouguet of roses for her birthday. Although she said that I didn't have to get them for her, I could see that they made her really happy.

8. Have you raised a pet?
I got a puppy when I was ten. He was a small poodle that used to follow me everywhere I went. I was in charge of feeding him and, since I loved to do it, he became a bit overweight.

PART 2&3

1. Describe an interesting wild animal.
The most interesting wild animal to me is the polar bear. Polar bears are quite large, weighing up to 700 kilograms. And they are all white aside from their black noses. This allows them to blend in with the snowy landscapes they inhabit. It also makes them look like giant white teddy bears.
I first saw a polar bear in a Coke commercial as a kid. Even though it was an animated bear, it was the first time I learned they exised.
Later, when I was in middle school, my class visited the zoo and I got to see polar bears with my own eyes for the first time. It was really awesome seeing them swimming and catching fish. However, I was taken aback when I saw how large they really are.
I think these white bears are indeed interesting for a couple of reasons. Although they seem really cute like cartoon characters, they're one of the most powerful predators in the world. Plus, despite their massive size, they can run faster than deer and swim faster than seals!

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of having pets?
The best thing about having a pet is that it is good for your mental health. When you have a pet, you never fell lonely because they always show their affection. On the downside, pets require a lot of maintenance. You need to have a great deal of time and energy to take care of them. Feeding them, playing with them, and keeping them clean are not always easy jobs.

3. What kind of pet is most common in your country?
There are many different kinds of pets in Korea, but dogs are the most common. People here enjoy having dogs because they are loyal. Dogs always wait at the door for their owners to come home. Plus, they put people in a good mood. For example, when you come home after a long day, your dog comes running to you and wants to play. This makes it hard to stay angry or sad and makes you feel better.

4. Describe an occasion when the wather disrupted your plans.
I'd like to tell you about a trip last year, which didn't go as I expected. My family and I had planned a trip to Jeonju, a city famous in Korea for its historic buildings and traditional foods. We'd spent weeks planning the trip and had already reserved our hotel, dinner, and some tours of the old buildings. So, everyone was really excited.
Unfortunately, on the day we were supposed to leave, it was raining cats and dogs. The rain was so heavy that we couldn't see in front of our car.
Therefore, we had no choice but to cancel the trip. We couldn't risk driving under those conditions. Instead, we just stayed home and watched a movie.
I was really disappointed. I was looking forward to the trip and I had put in so much work planning it. To make matters worse, we still had to pay for the hotel and some of the attraction tickets, since we canceled at the last minute. I think I'll keep an eye on the weather forecast next time I plan a trip.

5. Do people often have conversations about the weather? Why?
Yes, people often talk about the weather. First, talking about the weather keeps things light and simple. There are some subjects that could start an argument, like politics, but making a remark about the weather never causes any problems. Besides, it's a good way to start a conversation with anyone. Sometimes, we don't know exactly what to say but feel like it is necessary to say something. In these cases, the weather is the perfect topic.

6. What do people do in each type of weather?
People do several different things according to the weather. On warm and sunny days, people like to spend their time outside. They have picnics or take strolls in parks. I guess that's because people generally like to bathe in the sun. On the other hand, people tend to stay indoors when it's rainy and gloomy. They sometiems watch television or read books.
