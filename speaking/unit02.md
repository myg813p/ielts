Unit 2 

Part I

1. Do you live in an apartment or a house?
I live in a studio apartment. It consists of a single room and has just enough space for a bed and a desk. Even though it's quite small, it's cozy and comfortable.

2. What do you like about your house or apartment?
Let's see. First of all, my apartment is convieniently located. It's only about 3 minutes from the nearest bus stop. Secondly, it is not only well-lit but it also has a great heating and cooling system. So, it's warm in the winder and cool in the summer.

3. What do you not like about your house or apartment?
I'm content with nearly everything about my apratment, except for my upstairs neighbor. He is so noisy. For instance, he sometimes practices guitar in the middle of the night. What's more, he plays loud music all the time at full volume.

4. What room in your house or apartment do you prefer most?
I like my bedroom the most. There are a lot of cushions in it, so it is really snug. Moreover, I've got a big TV hanging on the wall. I love to watch movies while lying in bed.

5. What can you see from the window of your house or apartment?
I can see other apartment buildings and the street from my window. There are also several shops directly across from my house. To be more specific, there is a florist, a small grocery store, and a laundry service.

6. How long have you been living there?
I've been living there for 2 years now. I moved to my apartment right after graduating from high school. That's because I had to find a new place near campus, since my university is really far from my parents' house.

7. Will you keep living there in the future?
To be honest, I have no idea. I don't have any plans to move right now. However, if I get a new job or get married, I might need to find an apartment somewhere else.

8. Do you want to live near your family when you get your own house?
Yes, I'd love to. Even after I get my own place, I want to stay near my family if I can. That's because I don't want to spend hours on the road whenever I visit my parents. Besides, if I lived near her house, my mom would bring me hot food from time to time.

PART 2&3

1. Describe an important building in your town.
There are many important buildings in our town. but the 63 Building comes to mind first. It is located in Yeouido, overlooking the Han River. The closest subway station is Yeouinaru Station and it takes about 10 minutes on foot to get to the 63 Building.
As the name implies, the 63 Building has 63 floors. It also has a unique exterior because it's covered in windows that are a golden-yellow color. Due to its appearance, it's sometimes called the "Golden Tower" as well.
The last time I visited the building was about a month ago. My sister and I went to one of its most popular facilities, the aquarium. We saw many different kinds of sea creatures, such as seals, dolphins, and penguins there. We also enjoyed the view of the city from the observatory on the building's top floor. The night view of Seoul was breathtakingly beautiful.
The building is significant because it was the tallest building in Korea when it was built. Nowadays, the 63 Building is one of the most famous buildings in Korea and acts as a landmark of Seoul. In fact, the building even represented the city in the world-famous movie The Avengers.

2. What are the differences between modern buildings and traditional buidlings?
There are significant differences between modern and traditional buidings. First of all, their construction materials are very different. In the past, buildings were mostly built with natural materials like wood or soil. However, modern buidings are constructed with stronger, man-made materials, such as concrete and steel. Another difference between modern and traditional buildings is height. Buildings today are constructed to be taller than ever. You can see many more high-rise skyscrapers today than in the past.

3. Does a regin's climate affect the way buildings are consturcted?
Yes, it does influence the area's buildings. For example, in tropical areas where there is a lot of rainfall, buildings usually have sloped roofs. This helps water fall down more effectively. If the roofs were flat, rain would sit on the roof and that would be problematic.

4. Describe your ideal future home.
My ideal future home would have to be very big because I've wanted to live in a large home with my whole family ever since I was young. It would have big windows, too. That would let in tons of natural light and fresh air and help me to wake up in the morning. I also want to have a pool in the backyard, so I could invite my friends over for pool parties. In addition, it should have a gorgeous garden where my mom could spend her time. Lastly, a large and cozy living room would be a must for our family quality time.
I don't really care about the location, as long as it's near the beach. But a city like Miami, SantaBarbara, or Busan would be great.
As I mentioned earlier, I want my whole family, inclouding my grandparents, to live there with me.
Living with my extended family has always been my dream, and living in this house would make my dream come true. I'm sure my home would always be filled with laughter and joy.

5. Do people prefer living in apartments or houses in your country? Why?
I think people in my country generally prefer to live in apartments. This is because apartment buildings usually have better security. For instance, there are CCTV cameras in every hallway of an apartment building. You can find guards on duty as well. Furthermore, modern apartment buildings are often equipped with various amenities, like pools, gyms, and convenience store. Having these things in the complex makes life more convenient.

6. Some poeple prefer living in a small house to living in a big house. Why is that?
The specific reasons would be different from person to person, but I think people prefer smaller homes because they are far easier to maintain. They require much less time and effort to clean, and repairs are usually relatively minor. Also, smaller homes are less expensive. This makes them a much better choice for people who are on a budget.
