Unit06 Fashion & Shopping

PART 1.

1. What kind of factors do you consider when buying a bag?
There are two things I consider when I buy a bag. First, I look for a bag that matches well with my clothes. Second, since I carry many different items, it is handy to have one with many pockets and compartments.

2. Do you carry different bags depending on the situation?
Yes, I certainly do. I usually like to carry around my gray fabric backpack because it is comfortable and has a lot of room. However, on formal events, such as a friend's wedding, I take a basic black leather bag with me.

3. When do people wear hats or caps in your country?
In Korea, people generally wear hats and caps when they go hiking or go to the beach. I guess it is to protect their eyes and face from the glaring sunlight. Additionally, because young people here consider caps and beanies fashion items, they like to wear them when they dress to impress.

4. Do you wear caps for your convenience or for fashion?
I usually wear them for my convenience. If I can't wash my hair and it's a bit greasy, I put on a cap. That way, I can hide my greasy hair. So, caps are pretty useful when I don't have much time to get ready in the morning. 

5. Do you like to wear fashinable shoes or comfortable shoes?
I try to go for both qualities when buying shoes. I like comfortable shoes, but obviously I don't want to wear something ugly. So when I shop for shoes, I visit as many stores as possible to find the right pair for me.

6. How often do you buy shoes?
On average, I think I buy shoes once every 6 months or so. Because I love to walk around, my shoes tend to wear out pretty quickly. Therefore, I need to get new ones more often than most other people.

7. What is your favourite colour?
My favorite color is black because it goes with everything, and it's so chic. Therefore, most of my possessions, including my clothes, are black. Even though my mom always says that I should wear brighter colors, I can't help but buy black clothing.

8. Do you like shopping?
Of course! Who doesn't like it? When I go shopping, I get to discover cool and stylish new products, so it is very exciting for me. Additionally, It's very fun to compare different items and try to get the best deal. I love shopping so much that I can do it all day.

PART2&3

1. Describe a clothing item that you like.
I'd like to tell you about my duck-down coat, which is my favorite clothing item. It's a great coat taht is long enough to cover my knees. That means I don't have to worry about wind on my legs. Also, it has six pockets, which offers me room for my hands and all the things I need to carry.
My mother gave it to me for my birthday last year. At the time, I had been shopping for a new coat, but all the good-looking ones cost an arm and a leg for a student like me. Therefore, I was so grateful when I received this coat.
I absolutely love this coat for several reasons. First of all, it is warm enough for me to endure the freezing Korean winters. Actually, I didn't used to go out much in winter because I'm very sensitive to cold temperatures. But, thanks to this coat, I went outside a lot last winter. Moreover, its design is just my type. I especially like its color, block. I love the color black since it goes with everything. Plus, dirt and stains are less noticeable on it.

2. Why do peple dress differently at work than at other times?
The specific reasons differ from person to person, but it seems that it's mostly because people are expected to look prefessional at work. Therefore, most employees show up at the office in suits or other outfits appropriate for a business setting. On the other hand, when people say at home or meet their friends, they want to be comfortable. So, they generally wear casual clothing, like jeans, T-shirts, and sneakers.

3. What are the pros and cons of wearing a uniform?
One main advantage is that it is a lot easier and quicker to get dressed in the morning if uniforms are required. When you only have one wardrobe option, you don't need to spend time selecting appropriate clothes for work or school. On the other hand, having to wear a uniform can limit your individuality. Choosing to war certain clothes is one way of expressing your personality. However, if you have to wear the same outfit as everyone else, you can't do that.

4. Describe your favourite item.
I've bought many things, but my favorite purchase of all time is my laptop. It was one of the latest models when I bought it, and it still has cutting edge features.
I bought it last year at a year-end sale at the shopping mall. It was a  bit pricey, but I got a great deal on it. I saved nearly 50 percent off the regular price!
I think I've used it every day sice I purchased it. In fact, I do all of my assignments, paperwork, and research on it. When I'm not using it for those things, I also use it for entertainment. I usually play games on it.
There are a couple of things that I like about my laptop. First, its design really suits my taste. It's so chic that I want to show it to everyone. Moreover, it is speedy. My previous laptop took more than 5 minutes just to boot up. But this one works so fast that I don't get stressed out due to its speed. It's also small and lightweight. It weighs less than a kilogram and easily fits into my backpack.

5. Tell me about the benefits and drawbacks of onlie shopping.
The main advantage is that online shopping is convenient. You can make a purchase with a few clicks without having to go anywhere. But, as for its disadvantages, you might purchase something that doesn't fit properly since you can't try anything on. Even worse, it is difficult to get a refund or replacement when you get items that are not your size.

6. Do people prefer small shops or large shops in your country?
I think individual preferences differ from person to person. However, most people seem to prefer large shops to smaller ones. For one, bigger stores tend to offer more diverse products than small shops because their large size can accommodate a greater inventory. Plus, I think shoppers receive better service at large stores because there are plenty of employees who have been specially trained to handle customer needs.
