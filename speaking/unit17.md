UNIT 17. Science & Technology

PART 1.

1. Do you like science?
Quite a bit, expecially the parts related to astronomy. For example, I love to read and watch programs about space. Whenever I learn a new fact about the universe, I get really excited. I'm so glad that more documentary series about space are being shown on TV these days.

2. Do you think science is imporatant?
Yes, I think it is important because science improves our lives. For example, we might be able to cure diseases like cancer and AIDS one day because of a scientific breakthrough. Furthermore, science can give us clean energy sources that do not harm the environment.

3. What do you usually use computers for?
I mostly use computers to do Internet searches. However, I occasionally play games or shop online when I have free time as well. Moreover, I sometimes take my laptop to coffee shops and libraires to get some work done.

4. Do you think the importance of computers will increase in the future?
If portable devices, such as smartphones and tablets, can also be considered computers, then my answer is yes. People increasingly rely on the Internet to do things these days, and we will probably depend on it even more in the future. Therefore, any piece of equipment that can access the Internet will be more important.

5. What are the drawbacks of using computers?
I think using computers makes us overly dependent on them. Last month, my computer broke down while I was at home. Since all my files and programs were stored in that computer, I couldn't work or play any games and became really frustrated. That incident made me realize that I depend on my computer too much.

6. What kind of jobs do you think need computer skills?
I have to say taht having at lest some knowledge of computers is essential for any job in today's world. Most companies nowadays use computers to do business. Therefore, it's vital that employees know how to use them properly.

7. Do you use social networking sites?
Yes, I log onto social networking sites from time to time. When I visit these sites, I mostly look at my friends' posts and photos. Some of them like to write reviews of the restaurants they go to, and these posts are very helpful to me.

8. Do you think many people use social networking sites in your country?
I'm pretty sure that a lot of Koreans use social networking sites these days. In fact, most of my friends use more than one such site. Even my father, who's over fifty years old, signed up for an account recently. He visits the site to get in touch with his friends.

PART 2&3

1. Describe a useful smartphone application.
There are so many valuable mobile phone applications out there, but the map application comes to mind first. It, of course, shows basic maps, but it also gives detailed directions. All I have to do is type in my destination, and then it shows me the directions and provides an estimate for how long it will take to get there. If I'm taking  a bus or the  subway, it will even tell me any transfer information, how long I'll have to wait, and the cost of the trip.
I use the app nearly every day and can't live without it. Since it also updates information on traffic conditions, it helps me decide whether to travel by bus, taxi, or the subway.
This app is very handy, and it's helped me out a lot. I used to get lost all the time, even on familiar routes. But now, I can just c heck the app if I don't know where I am. This is especially useful on international trips. I can use the app to find my way regardless of whether I understand the local language or not. It's saved me a lot of time and stress.

2. What are the differences  between applications used by old people and young people?
I'd say that these are some differences between the apps that the elderly use and those that the young use. Older people tend to only use basic apps that have been on the market for a while. This is because older poeple often worry that new apps will be difficult to learn. Therefore, they tend to only use apps for simple tasks, like sending messages and setting alarms. On the other hand, young people are attracted to new apps and learn how to use them quickly. Also, they use these apps for more diverse puposes, like editing photos and tracking their fitness levels.

3. What are some popular applications in your country?
The most popular appication in my country seems to be the messaging app. This is the most basic app, and I've never seen anyone who doesn't use it. It can be used to send text and voice messages as well as pictures and videos. Another commonly used application is the web browser. With this app, people can search for things and view information. This is actually the app I use most often. I open it every morning to check out the latest news.

4. Descibe a branch of science that you are familiar with.
I'd like to talk about chemistry which is the area of science I'm most interested in.
It may seem odd, but I first learned about the study of chemistry after having my first Diet Coke. I couldn't figure out how in the world it could taste the same as regular Coke but be calorie-free. So, I did some research to see how this was possible. It turned out the secret is using artificial sweeteners as a substitute for sugar. Reading about these amazing chemicals made a big impression on me and got me interested in learning more.
In my opinion, chemistry has affected our lives in many positive ways. First of all, the invention of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides has greatly improved our agricultural efficiency. This has reduced the threat of famine around the world. Second, since medicines are basically just mixtures of various chemicals, it's safe to say that the study of chemistry has cured many dangerous diseases and extended our lives.

5. What area of science has influenced our society the most?
There are many areas of scientific study that have greatly affected our society, but I think computer science has brought about the biggest chagnes. The invention of computers has increased our efficiency significantly. Computers have not only made it possible to perform calculations faster, but they have also made maintaining and analyzing databases easier. What's more, the Internet has connected people from all over the world and enabled rapid information exchanges. For example, social networking sites give people the opportunity to instantly share anything with anyone.

6. Are there any negative effects due to the development of science?
Yes, I'd have to say that scientific development can have an unfavorable impact on society. To begin with, scientific invention can be detrimental to the environment. For instance, science has facilitated the production of harmful chemicals that create a lot of pollution. In addition, science threatens human life. One example of this is nuclear wapons. These scientifically designed weapons threaten international peace and can lead to the deaths of innocent people.
