Recently, researchers from the University of Otago made a surprising discovery. They found the remains of eggs from the tuatara on New Zealand's South Island. This was important because tuatara had not reproduced on either of New Zealand's two main islands in over a century. The new discovery has conservationists excited because it shows that efforts to reintroduce breeding populations on the mainland have been successful.

These small reptiles have a crest of triangular skin down their backs and can grow to approximately 75 centimetres. They are the only living species of the order Rhynchocephalia, which flourished over 200 million years ago. This may be attributable to living on remote islands with no large predators. These islands have large seabird populations that produce guano, which attracts the parasites that the tuataras eat. Both of these factors allowed them to flourish for hundreds of millions of years.

Unfortunately, human activity greatly affected the tuatara populations. This is because non-native animals, such as rats, that ate the tuataras; eggs were introduced when humans arrived on the islands. This devastated the population due to their low reproductive rate. It is estimated that around 25 per cent of the tuatara died due to these rats.

Surprisingly, climate change also has a strong influence on the numbers of the tuatara. Tuatara gender, like that of some other reptiles, is dependent upon nest temperature. When nests are 21'C or below, the hatchlings will be female but even a 1' increase in temperature will produce males. Rising temperatures are now reducing the likelihood of new hatchlings being female. Because of this, researchers musst find innovative conservation techniques to save this ancient species.
