The history of mining in Nevada, nicknamed the 'Silver State', is so intertwined with the history of the state that, at certain points, the two cannot be separated. In fact, were it not for mining, Nevada would probably not have achieved statehood until decades later than it did. As it was, the Silver State bought its way into the Union with silver mined in the famous Comstock Lode. In the mid-1800s, the area that would become Nevada was mostly a highway for thouse heading to search for gold in California. In 1859, however, the discovery of massive silver deposits quickly made Virginia City the most famous of all western mining camps. The rapid influx of prospectors and settlers resulted in the organisation of the Nevada Territory just two years later.

In the east, the American Civil War was brewing. Lincoln, realising the area's great mineral wealth could help the Union, and needing another state to support his proposed anti-slavery amendment to the Constitution, encouraged the territory to seek admission to the Union. Even though Nevada boasted only about one-fifth of the 127,381 people required for statehood, with the motto 'Battle Born', it was admitted as the 36th state in 1864. Sice then, mining's impact on Nevada's economy has remained immense, both in the influx of money it has brought in boom times and in the noticeable economic downturns during periods of low demand.
