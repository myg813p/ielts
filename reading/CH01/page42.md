Given that the Mediterranean Sea is in an extremely dry area of the world and that i receives the water from the Atlantic Ocean via the narrow Strait of Gibraltar, it is actually very vulnerable to evaporation. In fact, archeological evidence shows that global cooling about five milion years ago caused parts of the Atlantic Ocean to freeze, resulting in the sea level dropping about 70 meters. This stemmed the flow of water from the Atlantic into the Strait of Gibraltar, thereby greatly reducing the amount of water the Mediterranean received. At the same time, the movement of tectonic plates resulted in Europe and Africa drawing closer to one another, This raised the land high enough to further block the MEditerranean from the Atlantic Ocean. It was not long before the warm water remaining in the Mediterranean Sea began to vanish, leaving behind nothing but salt.
