In Ancient Greece, the prevailing religious traditions centred around Dionysus, a saviour god who was associated with the sowing and reaping of corn, the production of grapes, and intoxication. Patrons held seasonal festivals in his honour, the most important of which was the autumn wine tasting celebration, known as the Dionysus Festical, and this included the recitation of choric poems or hymns. Revellers chanted odes, called dithyrambs, to their illustrious god while a priest would respond in a symbolic interation between humans and the spirits. Due to its popularity within the higher and lower social classes, by the 6th century B.C., the Corinthian king established a dithyramb competition and invited a select group of poets to  compose and perform these pseudo-dramas. For the first tiem, the plays were freed from their religious roots and transfromed into full-fledged works of art. The changing theatre environment altered attitudes across Greece and thus triggered a newfound secular interest that would bring about a refinement of the art form.
