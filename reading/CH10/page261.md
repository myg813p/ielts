Aninals have an internal mechanizm that responds rhytthmically to environmental cycles. Acycle can operate according to many different time frames, but the most obvious among them are those related to lunar phases, seasonal patterns, and the 24-hour cycle. The mechanism, called a biological clock, functions to make an animal aware of upcoming environmental events and to regulate when it sleeps, mates, and feeds. The kind of biological clock an organism has generally depends on its genetics rather than on external stimuli. Creatures such as crabs innately regulate their behaviours according to the rise and fall of the tides. Meanwhile, in areas of the world where there are dramatic changes in the length of the day and night as the wather gets colder, most animals are influenced by seasonal patterns. For instance, a brown bear's biological clock will perceive that the days are getting shorter as winter approaches and respond by eating large quantities of food before entering a state of hibernation.
