The cocoa bean had enormous significance to the Aztec people. Unlike the chocolate we make with it today, it was mostly combined with chilli peppers or vanilla and used to make a spicy beverage during the time of the Aztecs. However, this was no dessert. Historical chronicles have noted that the beverage, often drunk at the end of a banquet and served with tobacco, could be incredibly intoxicating. This has caused some scholars to speculate that the drink was mixed with wine or that its contents underwent fermentation in order to turn it into alcohol. Perhaps it was this effect that made it valuable enough to be regarded as an acceptable form of currency. But it more likely had to do with the fact  that the Aztecs believed that the cocoa tree was a bridge connecting heaven and Earth and that consuming cocoa beans instilled one with divine wisdom. For this reason, drinks made of cocoa were often included in ritual sacrifices to the gods, used to celebrate special occasions, and mostly limited to members of the upper echelons of society. But there was one problem. Cocoa would not row at the Aztec court of Tenochtitlan, where the climate was too cool and dry. Luckily for the Aztecs, it could be acquired in conquered states. Under Aztec rule, these states were required to pay a tax in the form of ggods and labour, called a tribute. When it came time to collect resources from these area, cocoa beans were undoubtedly a top priority.
