The mural, a type of artwork that involves applying paint directly to a wall, ws the earliest kind of painting. murals could not be detached, but later, the technique of painting on panels was developed. Panel paintings were done on thin strips of wood that were later put together. This production process also made it possible to quickly take them apart later. Quitck disassembly was a feature which made these paintings highly portable. In the 14th century, painters began painting on fabric canvas, which was easy to work with and transport as it was lightweight. The surface of canvas held paint much better than wood did and was not prone to warping and cracking. However, the woven fabric affected the surface of paintings in a way that Renaissance artists disliked. They wanted to attain a glossy finish, and therefore went to great lengths to smooth the texture of the painting so that it had a similar feel to a photograph.
