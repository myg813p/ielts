While pet owners have long believed that their animal companions display feelings such as empathy, jealousy, and guilt, scientists have historically said that this was impossible. They held that only humans felt emotions and that our recognition of them in other species was due to anthropomorphism, or the attribution of human traits to animals, However, recent research has shown that this may noy actually be true. By utilising testing methods usually used on non-verbal infants, researchers Christine Harris and Caroline Prouvost of the University of California, San Diego found that dogs displayed jealous behaviours when their owners showed affection to other dogs. The discovery of demonstrable jealousy in another social species indicates that emotions are not likely a strictly human trait. Historical anthropologists like Laurel Braitman and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas take this further. They suggest that emotions have evolutionary value and that when we see a human emotion in animals, we may be recognising a common feature acquired long ago in our shared past.
