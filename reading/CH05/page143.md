Found in Southeast Asia and Australia, weaver ants are most notable for their ability to construct nests from living leaves located high in the treetops. Like most ant varieties, a weaver ant's life revolves around providing for its queen. In fact, it is to serve her that they build their nests in the first place. It all starts with a queen founding a colony by laying a clutch of eggs on a leaf and raising the larvae until they become mature workers. In order to increase the size of the colony, the queen must lay more eggs, but this will require additional living space for the already mature ants. Thus, a nest must be built - a task that requires significant collaboration, Fist, a single ant reaches toward a distant leaf. Unable to get to it alone, the other ants hold onto the first ant, forming a chain undtil the leaf is finally graped. Once they have it, they pull as one until both leadves have been drawn together. Keeping the leaves in place, they wait for other workers to arrive carrying larvae, which are capable of producing silk. The larvae are prompted to release the silk from their salivary glands, and the worker ants dab the sticky substance from one leaf to another, essentially binding them. Ultimately, the process is repeated until a nest large enough to accommodate the colony's growing population has been constructed, and the cycle is likewise repeated each time the queen lays more eggs.
