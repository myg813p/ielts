While companies were established to produce a product or perform a service for a profit, there is a general consensus that they should give back to the community as well. Many corporate owners and managers share this belief and feel that they have a responsibility to improve conditions for the disadvantaged. Some of these, such as Toms Shoes, were actually established with this in mind. Since its foundation, Toms has given one pair of shoes to a person in need for every pair sold. To date, this has resulted in the donation of more than 50 milion pairs of shoes. The cosmetics company NuSkin is another example of a socially responsible company. They set up an initiative called Nourish the Children, which allows customers to donate healthy meals to impoverished children when making a purchase. These types of programmes are praiseworthy for their impact on poverty, but they also help the bottom line of companies who undertake them. By advertising these types of socially responsible programmes, companies boost profits. This is because the programmes make customers who are concerned about social issues feel that they are doing good in the world by patronising the company. Overall, these thpyes of corporate programmes have a positive impact on everyone involved and should be an example of other companies to follow.
