A statue of Shakespearem the world's most renowned playwright, stands in Leicester Square in London;s West End. Rather appropriately, too, as the West End is a major attraction, boasting about 40 venues that show some of the highest quality theatre in the world. The area - also known as Theatreland - has a rich history, with many of the theatres dating back to the Victorian and Edwardian periods. These historic buildings now coexist with contemporary shops and offices in what is now one of London's busiest districts. The oldest of these West End theatres is Theatre Royal Drury Lane which opened in 1663, although it has been rebuilt s everal times due to fire. West End theatres continue to put on an array of shows including contemporary productions, revivals of classics, and, most famously, musicals. The latter draw the most viewers, and have been known to run for decades. This is the case with the Les Miserables and The Phantom of the Opera, which both opend in the mid-1980s and are among the highest grossing of all West End productions.
