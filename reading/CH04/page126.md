#### Do Placebos Have a Place in Medicine?

A placebo is an imitation medicine that doctors sometimes administer to patients. Although they contain no pharmacological substances, patients who are given placebos are often convinced that these sugar pills possess the power to alleviate their symptoms or even cure them of their illnesses. What is most remarkable is that sometimes, they do. This baffling psychological and medical phenomenon is known as the pacebo effect.

Some medical practitioners believe taht the apparent efficacy of placebos lies in the simple act of writing a prescription. Essentially, it is thought that patients assume their ailments can be overcome if it is possible to prescribe medications for them. this veiw is substantiated by studies indicating that a large percentage of those seeking medical treatment suffer from disorders that the body is capable of healing itself. However, patients strongly think otherwise, and this attitude makes them attribute getting better, when they eventually do, solely to the medication they were prescribed. This, coupled with the trust they have in ther doctor's ability to treat them, is what some say accounts for the positive performance of placebos.

Nevertheless, most experts strongly oppose medicating patients with placebos, suggesting the practice violates the doctor-patient relationship. Medical ethics standards maintain that trust is paramount and that doctors should be honest. However, some physicians are tempted to provide misinformation or gloss over the truth because they believe doing so is in the patient;s best interests. For instance, a doctor may choose to present patients with a more optimistic picture of possible outcomes in order to convince them to undergo teatments they might otherwise reject. It is the hope that comes from believing it is still possible to be cured that can make all the difference in the end.

Further studies report of some patients learning they have been given placebos instead of actual drugs. In many cases, this causes patients to lose faith in their doctors, resulting in exacerbated symptoms and their health taking a turn for the worse. Due to the possibility of malpractice suits, the use of placebos in clinical practice has become increasingly uncommon. These days, placebos are almost exclusively administered in research situations where the subjects are informed that they may or may not receive a placebo and told about all potential risks in advance. In addition, policies are implemented to ensure that informed consent is observed, thus aligning standards for medical research and practice with the need for further investigation into the so-called placebo effect.
