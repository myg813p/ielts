If you have ever been snorkelling or diving along a tropical coral reef, then you have probably heard regular cunching sounds while underwater. These are made when the colourful parrotfish remove algae from the reef's surface by biting and scraping it whti their parrot-ike beaks. The lifecycle of these fascinating fish begins when they treavel into the open sea to discharge their eggs, where they hatch. Following this their early life is spent as larvae in the ocean's pankton population. They then move to the mangroves as juveniles and then to  a reef where they will both hide from pedators and clean the reef. Interestinly, throughout these stages of development, all parrotfish are drably coloured females. This is because parrotfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning they change gender as they age. When they enter the terminal phase of their lives, the young female parrotfish morph into more colourful males. These males then collect a harem of younger female parrotfish and spawn to produce yet anotyher all-female group of larval parrotfish. A further interesting aspect of the parrotfish is its importance in the reef's survivval. According to researchers at the IOnternational Union for Conservation of Nature, without the cleaning activities of the parrotfish, the reefs would soon be overrun with algae and die.
