Prairie ecosystems are characterised by even terrain or gently sloping rolling hills, and by a predominance of herbaceous plant life. Trees, shrubs, and other woody plants are virtually absent in prairies, and there is very little shelter from the solar radiation and harsh breezes. Prairies generally receive a moderate amount of yearly precipitation, but summers are occasionally marked by severe drought. Consequently, for palnts to thrive in the prairie ecosystem, they must endure seasonally dry conditions. Among the herbaceous plants suited for life in these ecosystems are prairie grasses, which have several adaptive mechanisms for survival.

Leaves of prairie grasses vary in width, but nost are long, thin blades. On the epidermal layer of the leaves are small holes, called stomata, which can be opened to let in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, or closed to retain moisture. Because carbon dioxide is essential for plant photosynthesis, the stomata must remain wide ofr gas exchange; however, air spaces within the leaf are full of water vapour, which evaporates unliess the pores remain closed and presents a challenge during dry conditions. To overcome the problem, prairie grasses have evolved to distinguish between day and night. In he daytime, the grasses keep their  stomata shut to minimise moisture loss. The palnts then expand the pores in the evening when tieh air is cooler for respiration.
