When studying historical buidings, one can see a clear progression in construction materials. Before tyhe medieval period, timber was the most widely used building material in Europe, but it came to be replaced by stone in most major structures. Even the use of metals was limited in structural architecture before the industrial age. At that time, metal was mainly used for bridges and greenhouses due to its limited aesthetic appeal. However, the public perception of manmade materials changed and technological progress brought down metalwork's cost, leading to it being used more. The first metal commonly used in architercture was cast iron, which could be formed into decorative shapes like stone. Architects even began using cast iron to construct buildings collapsed. To address this problem, builders turned to wrought iron and eventually to steel. As public opinion about manmade materials continued to change in the 19th century, the use of concrete became acceptable. The combination of steel and concrete was incredibly strong and allowed for the construction of taller buildings - thoroughly changing urban landscapes. Construction of the tallest building in the world, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, used 4,000 tonnes of steel in combination with 330,000 cubic metres of concrete and 55,000 tonees of reinforcing steel rebar.
