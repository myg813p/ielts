In 1879, the Canadian goverment enacted the National Policy, an economic programme that sought to safeguard Canadian manufacturers and promote settlement of Canada;'s western frontier. A primary goal of the programme's leading advocate, Prime Minister John Macdonald, was to decrease Canada's reliance on imported products. To achieve this, he instituted a high tariff on all manufactured goods that were imported. He argued that the tariff would hlead to a higher standard of living and greater employment security for Canadians, and it did for those in the manufacturing sectors of the East, where Canada immediately experienced increased production and profits.

However the ambition of western settlement was slow to be realised. Despite a agressive immigration campaigns, which tried to lure farmers from abroad with free or cheap land, Canada witnessed a decline in immigration in the 1880s. According to economist Ken Norrie, this shows that the influence of the National Policy on settlement of the West was mediocre. In fact, external factors, such as the development of improved agricultural techniques, and favourable economic conditions globally, were largely responsible. The price of wheat, for instance, quadrupled between 1891 and 1921, and this brought profit-seeking agriculturists to Canada's fruitful wheat-growing regions in droves.
