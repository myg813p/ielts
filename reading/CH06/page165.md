Although attaching studs and spikes t o clothing is associated with the punk and metal subcultures of the 1980s, the pratice is nothing new. In fact, studs and spikes have been around for as long as it has been necessary to protect oneself and exude a spirit of aggression. The medienal briganding, for instance, was a form of armour that consisted of steel plates on top of fabric, and the plates were riveted there by fasteners that resembled the studs used in contemporary fashions. But apart from keeping the steel plates attached, they also helped absorb the shock from beavy blunt wapons and made it more difficult for blades to pierce through. The same idea was applied to the protective clothing put on animals. Hunting dogs, notably, were often put in spiked collars when their ancient Roman owners took them out to capture dangerous game, like lions and bears. This way, if a dog were to get bitten on the neck, the spikes would protect it and likely injure the more savage beast in the process. And because it was quite obvious that the only individuals who wore studded or spiked garments in the first place were warriors, intimidation was one of the reasons as well; people automatically stayed away from anyone in such clothing. Essentially, while studs and spikes may not serve many practical applications today, they live on as a symbole of ferocity and as a warning to others to keep their distance.
