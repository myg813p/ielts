It may be tempting to put on a false face or stretch the truth at times, but it turns out tht even the most convincing among us may be incapable of pulling off an act of deception that leaves no one in doubt. This it because muscles in the human face react involuntarity to emotions. The scowls, smirks, and frowns that can betray how a liar truly feels may only flash across his or her face for a brief moment - so brief, in fact, that research psychologist Paul Ekman called these emotional displays 'micro expressions' - but they do occur, and they are detectable. According to Ekman, ther are seven universal micro expressions: disgust, anger, fear, sadness, happiness, surpise, and contempt. When we feel any of these emotions, they are beyond our control for at least one twentieth of a second. Videotaping a person who is providing a false statement and then going through the tape frame by frame can reveal these expressions, even in people who seem very genuine in person. Of course, this may not always be an option. In such cases, keeping an eye out for hand gestures that obscure the face is advisable. People who move their hands toward their eyes or their mouths - the most expressive parts of the face - may be trying to avoid being caught in the split second that micro expressions occur.
