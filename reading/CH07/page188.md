Although known primarily for their honey production, bees are actually more important to human well-being as pollinators of the staple crops that make up our diet. In fact, the American Environmetal Protection Agency claims  that pollinators are responsible for nearly one in every three bites of food you eat. If this is true, then the fact that honeybee numbers are dwindling should be a major cause of concern, not only for their survival but for ours. A study carried out by Nicholas Calderone, associate professor of entomology at Cornell University, showed that crops pollinated by honeybees and other insects contiributed 29 billion dollars of annual farm income in the United States, revealing the extent of their importance both agriculturally and economically. This point was emphasised by Vera Lucia Imperatriz-Fonseca, senior professor at the University of Sao Paulo, who stated in a United Nations report that pollinator's health is directly linked to our own well-being. In fact, a study by Professor Simon Potts in the UK revealed how a massive decline in honeybee colonies has made agriculture reliant upon pollination by wild bee species, many of which are also under threat.
