### The Survival of Coral Reefs

#### A
In the tropical and subtropical regions of three major oceans - the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian - there is an abundance of coral  reefs of varying sizes. They lie no deeper than 200 feet below the ocean surface, for corals require sufficient sunlight, clear water, the presence of zooxanthellae or algae, and a temperature range of 17 to 34 degrees Celsius in order to thrive. Due to these specific ecological requirements, coral reefs are mostly found in areas where shallow submarine platforms occur in the Earth's southern hemisphere.

When the required conditions are met, corals can grow into massive structures. Living organisms, particularly the coral polyp, secrete calcium carbonate to create the hard exoskeleton of the coral. In time, coral colonies form a reef, a highly interconnected ecosystem of great diversity. As a reef grows, a complex system of mutual cooperation and symbiosis develops among many of the organisms that inhabit the corals. It is not an overstatement to say that corals are critical for the survival of numerous marine organisms. In fact, many describe coral reefs as the 'rainforests of the seas', and like rainforests, if destroyed, the organisms that depend on them either become endangered or are eliminated.

#### C
In the past few decades, scientists have discovered that corals are also important to humans in many ways. They not only provide a crucial ecosystem for ocean life, but they also remove carbon dioxide f rom the air and shelter land from ocean storms. Moreover, coral reefs attract tourists, providing employment valued at around 375 billion dollars annually. Despite the value of corals to humanity and their importance in maintaining the health of the oceans, they are increasingly at risk of destruction from human activity.

#### D
Research studies indicate taht the primary dangers to coral reefs are all related to human activity. When ocean waters become too warm, for example, due to global warming, corals expel the zooxanthellae living in their tissues. This causes the corals to turn white in colour, a phenomenon known as coral bleaching. Although the coral is not dead at this point, its health is in serious jeopardy. The use of pesticides and fertilisers, chemical pollution, sedimentation, deforestation, and oil slicks, have also all taken a toll on the corals.

#### E
These threats are increasing from year to year, and this is having dramatic consequences for the health of the corals. A study concluded that about 70 per cent of the world's coral reefs were either being threatened or destroyed by human activity. Although some reefs have the potential for recovery, about 20 per cent have no hope of revival. Jamaica's reefs have been hit the hardest, and about 95 per cent of them have now been completely destroyed.

A report on Australia's Great Barrier Reef concluded that a decline in water quality was causing deterioration in the health of the reef. In response, the Australian government has made a great effort to protect the reef, with the result that its ecosystem is more likely to survive than reefs located in other areas. It remains to be seen whether politicians around the world have the will, or the means, to follow suit and halt the decline of coral reefs before it is too late.
