#### A
Today, there are more than 350 extant species of parrots. These intelligent birds come in a variety of sizes and vibrant colours. While they are prized  as pets around the world for their ability to mimic speech, they are not always as beloved in their native lands.

#### B
One good example of this is Austrailia, which is home to the sulphur-crsted cockatoo, a large parrot with vivid yellow feathers on its bead. These birds move to large flocks and have become a nuisance to local inhabitants. not only do their chatter and pre-dawn calls disturb humans, but they are also very destructive. Local farmers and homeowners often complain that they are decimating crops and destroying timber used in homebuiilding by chewing on it. They are also expanding their territory, which displaces other native bird species.

#### C
To address these problems, sulphur-crested cockatoos have ben decleared a pest species in some areas. This prevents them from being imported into new areas and puts regulations on their ownership. In some regions, there are also reqular culls to keep the populations in check and to prevent them from damaging the local ecosystem. While these policies may have an impact, it is unclear whether they will resolve the issue.
