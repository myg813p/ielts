### Disappering Lions

#### A
Lions, which once roamed large expanses of Europe, began to dwindle in number during the end of the last ice age when climate change altered the landscape. Formerly, vast steppes - flat grassland areas - covered the continent, making it easy for lions to spot and capture their prey. But as the environment grew warmer and tall forests grew, other animals became far more difficult to hunt. With food harder to come by, it was impossible for lions to sustain their former numbers.

#### B
There were, however, occasional sightings of lions in southern Europe during historic times. According to ancient Greek historian Herodotus, the big cats could be found between the Achelos and Nestos rivers. As this is a relatively small geographical area, the species was probably already on its way to disappearing from the region at this time, with its demise no doubt hastened by the Greeks' love of sport hunting and the Romans'demand for beasts to fight in their arenas.

#### C
As for Africa, lions survived in significant numbers until the 19th century, when they began to vanish due to human population growth. Because machinery allowed people to access the wilderness, human contact with lions increased dramatically and so did the number of lions that were shot or poisoned with chemical pesticides. In fact, the lion population decresed by about 95 per cent in less than 200 years. Of the approximately 30,000 currently left on the continet, nearly all are in sub-Sahara and many face habitat repurposing, conflicts with farmers, and loss of prey due to the trade in bushmeat among humans. Given that the human population of this region is expected to double by the year 2050, the future for lions looks bleak.

#### D
The situation for lions in Asia is even worse. The sole surviving Asiatic lion population now lives in India's Gir National Park. Despite their protected status, the few hundred that live there are in severe danger because they are highly inbred, being descendants of only about a dozen lions. This makes them genetically weak and vulnerable to disease; if a contagious illness were to spread, many of the lions would perish, and their numbers might fall to unrecoverable levels.

#### E
With Asiatic lions being officially critically endangered and their African counterparts earning a recent endangered species listing by the U.S. Fish and Widlife Service, it is clear that conservationist groups want to protect the big cats from extinction. While their efforts are to be admired, the reality is that thte future of lions and the potential reversal of the patterns leading to their demise thus far will depend on a commitment to lion's protection on an international level.
