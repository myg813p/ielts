#### A
With today's aging population, the debate over seniors in the workforce has begun to heat up. Some people believe that their prolonged place in the workforce can be harmful to society. Others think senior employment can have positive consequences for social cohesion and economic growth.

#### B
Those who oppose employing seniors past the current age of retirement generally cite the argument that an aging workforce is less productive, as health issues and a lack of technical abilities limit the capacity of the elderly to do certain jobs. Although this may be the case with the very elderly, in the United Statues the current generation of over 60s is highly educated and relatively heathy, particularly in comparison to previous generations.

#### C
Others complain that it is too difficult to train seniors. They say, 'you can't teach an old dog new tricks'. However, this too is a misleading argument. Seniors have a wealth of experience which, with the right management, can be highly effective in the proper context. Many already have applicable skills that can be useful in the job market and are well-versed in the activities of the business world. eliminating the need for training altogether.

#### D
One argument against senior employment that dose have some validity is the fact that they reduce the number of jobs available in the market place. For every job that a senior is given, one job is unavailable for a younger person. While this is true, the jobs seniors and younger people generally look for are quite differnet. Instead of taking a job, they're usually filling a job that no one else wants, so it is clear that there is little reason to avoid hiring seniors. In fact, it will likely have a positive impact on both the senior and the employer. It will also reduce the need for seniors to rely upon social security programs or pensions, thereby saving money for the entire society.
