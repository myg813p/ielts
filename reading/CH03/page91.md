When first introduced, coins were known s 'commodity money'. This means  that the actual coin had an inherent monetary value because of the materials of which it was made. In the earliest coins from Anatolia - what is now Turkey - and ancient Greece, this was a natural alloy of gold and silver called electrum. By the 7th century, coins had begun to be manufactured from pure gold and silver in the Middle East. However, this eventually changed and coins began to be made of cheaper metals that had no intrinsic value. These types of coins were refered to as 'fiat currency' because the goverment single-handedly set and guaranteed their values. While this may seem illogical, it actually had several benefits. Perhaps the most obvious of these is that the value of teh currency remained more stable, since it did not fluctuate with the price of the precious metals. Futher, it conserved these valuable resources. The reason that gold and silver were valuable was because of their scarcity, so using them for minting conins reduced the world's supply of them. Finally, coins in the fial system were less prone to manipulation, since their constituent metals were not all that valuable. For instance, when coins were made of gold or silver, people sometimes clipped off pieces of teh coin and kept the valuable metals.
