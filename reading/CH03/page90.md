Some linguists believe that language comprehension is a learned skill and that adults will, therefore, be able to understand even unfamiliar language better than children. This theory rests on the idea that over time we develop the ability to understand both verbal and non-verbal clues when communicating. Since this is a learning process, it seems only logical taht children would be less skilled at discerning meaning from context. However, this is unlikely to be true. In fact, recent studies by linguists at Germany's Bielefeld University have shown that although children do not accurately anticipate visual clues while listening to stories, they are able to rapidly interpret visual clues to assist with their overall language comprehension. This does not mean that their skills will not improve over time, but it does show that determining context from non-auditory clues is a basic element of language comprehension.
