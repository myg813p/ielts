The Pueblo Indians were a major cultural influence in the United States' Four Corners region for over one thousand years. Initially, the civillisation was based in individual homesteads in the Colorado Pateau's highlands, where its members farmed and developed various handicrafts, such as pottery and blankets. However, during the 11th and 12th centuries the Pueblo moved into the neighbouring cayons and built the massive multifamily dwellings from which their names are derived. Archaeologist Kristen Kuckelman believes this occurred after persistent droughts made farming on plateau lands impossible. She believes taht the region's inhabitants moved into the valleys because they were less impacted by the droughts. After they migrated, they had to learn how to produce food more effecitively on less land, so they implemented a system of agricultural cooperation that eventually led to specialism. Once they settled in the canyons, the civillisation became increasingly more communal in order to maximise the returns on its labours.
