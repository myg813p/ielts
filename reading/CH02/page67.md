We now know that trees and other vegetation play an invaluable role in reducing air pollution in cites. Not so long ago, in the early 1980s, chemists discovered that trees produce emissions. This prompted the then U.S. President Ronald Reagan to falsely declare, 'Trees cause more pollution thatn automobiles do.' This, of course, caused people to speculate that trees were harmful, despite the facts that the words 'emission' and 'pollution' are not synonymous and that the president's remark was not accurate. While it is true that trees and plants, like all living things, emit chemical substances as byproducts of their metabolisms, these emissions are not a threat, but instead include the oxygen we breathe and the various chemical compounds that give flowers and shrubs their fresh and fragrant scents. It is only in the presence of significant amounts of man-made pollution, like that caused by the emissons of automobiles, that plants and trees release volatile organic hydrocarbons. But when they do, they can become participants in the formation of such ground-level ozone pollution as photochemical smog.
